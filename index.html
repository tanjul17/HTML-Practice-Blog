        A <em style="background-color: #1a89171a"> wonderful </em> serenity has
        taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
        <br />
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
        bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, <br />
        so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
        neglect my talents.

        I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
        and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. <br />
        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
        <em style="background-color: #1a89171a">
          the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
          of my trees,</em
        >
        <br />
        and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary exquisite
        sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
